Install instructions for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS)
--------------------------------------------------------

Getting DCSS to run
-------------------

This file describes how to compile a runtime executable of DCSS from the
source code.  If you're trying to compile Crawl yourself, skip ahead to the
next section, "Building Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup".

If, however, you're having trouble getting a precompiled binary to run:

1) Check whether you've downloaded and extracted the correct version.

    Platform        Tiles?          Download package
    --------        ------          ----------------
    Windows         yes             stone_soup-VERSION-tiles-win32.zip
    Windows         no              stone_soup-VERSION-win32.zip
    Mac OS X        yes             stone_soup-VERSION-tiles-osx.zip
                                    or stone_soup-VERSION-tiles-osx-app.dmg
    Mac OS X        no              stone_soup-VERSION-osx.zip
                                    or stone_soup-VERSION-osx-app.dmg
    Source code     yes             stone_soup-VERSION-src.zip
                                    or stone_soup-VERSION-src.tar.bz2

2) Try removing/renaming your saves/ directory in case older saves aren't
   recognized anymore.


If you still can't get Crawl to run, you can ask for further help on IRC:
##crawl-dev on freenode, forums: https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/ or usenet:
rec.games.roguelike.misc.  Please try to be as detailed as possible about
any error messages you're getting.

The rest of the file deals with compiling from the source.


Building Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup
---------------------------------

Crawl Stone Soup is known to run on the following platforms as of version
0.12:

- Any Unix with GNU or BSD userland.
- Mac OS X.
- Android.
- Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8

The only officially supported compilers are gcc (4.1 or newer) and clang
(3.0 or newer), with strong preference for the former.  On Windows, gcc is
usually available as MinGW; and as of version 0.13, compilation with MSVC
(Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 both Full or Express editions) is supported.

There's no reason Crawl shouldn't work on other modern systems, especially
Unixy ones, although some porting may be needed.

Windows 9X and ME are no longer supported but you may probably build for
them with relatively minor changes.


Source Code Checkout
--------------------

If you don't already have the source code downloaded (in the form of a .zip
or .tar.bz2 file), you can obtain the latest source code from Git.  MinGW
users can obtain Git by installing msysgit (described in the MinGW section).
Linux users can just install the 'git' or 'git-core' package with whatever
package manager they use.  Note that there used to be another package called
'git' (now 'gnuit') going around which stands for 'GNU interactive tools'.
This is not what you want.

Once you have Git installed, you just need to do:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/crawl/crawl.git

And then to get the contributing libraries, enter the newly cloned
repository via 'cd crawl' and type:

    git submodule update --init

This should get you all you need to build Crawl from source.


Optional libraries
------------------

Crawl can be built with some optional features:

* Sounds
* User Lua scripts

Crawl Stone Soup also uses a level compiler to compile special level
definitions; to make changes to the level compiler, you'll need the flex and
bison/byacc tools (Other lex/yaccs may also work).  More details are
available below.

Sounds must be enabled by editing AppHdr.h (uncomment SOUND_PLAY_COMMAND on
Unixes or WINMM_PLAY_SOUNDS on Windows).

Stone Soup 0.6 includes Lua 5.1.4 in its source tree. Crawl uses Lua for
dungeon generation.  In addition, Crawl has a (rudimentary) Lua interface
for users to run scripts which can do things such as conditionalise parts of
the .crawlrc/init.txt.  Such user Lua scripts are enabled by default, but
can be turned off by appending NO_LUA_BINDINGS=y to the make invocation.


Building on Unix (Linux, *BSD, Solaris, etc.)
---------------------------------------------

To install or not to install:

If only one user on the system (you) is going to be playing Crawl, you do
not need to use "make install".  A simple "make" will build Crawl in the
source directory, where you can run it as "./crawl".


Prerequisites (Debian):

On Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Mint, ...), you can get all dependencies by
typing the following as root/sudo:
apt-get install build-essential libncursesw5-dev bison flex liblua5.1-0-dev \
  libsqlite3-dev libz-dev pkg-config libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl1.2-dev      \
  libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev ttf-dejavu-core
(the last five are needed only for tiles builds).  This is the complete set,
with it you don't have a need for the bundled "contribs".

If you are going to be rebuilding after doing small changes a lot, it is
recommended that you also install and configure ccache and binutils-gold:
apt-get install ccache binutils-gold
less /usr/share/doc/ccache/README.Debian


Prerequisites (Fedora):

On Fedora, and possibly other RPM-based systems, you can get the dependencies
by running the following as root:
yum install gcc gcc-c++ make bison flex ncurses-devel lua-devel sqlite-devel \
  zlib-devel pkgconfig SDL-devel SDL_image-devel libpng-devel freetype-devel \
  dejavu-sans-fonts dejavu-sans-mono-fonts
(the last six are needed only for tile builds).  As with Debian, this package
list avoids the need for the bundled "contribs".

ccache can be installed with:
yum install ccache


Prerequisites (other systems):

GNU gcc and g++, GNU make, libncursesw or libcursesw. You need the development
headers for ncurses - they may not be installed by default on some Unixes.

For tile builds, you need FreeDesktop's pkg-config, X11 and opengl headers.
The latter are likely to come from mesa sources.

flex and bison are optional but highly recommended. Recent versions of byacc
are also fine (edit your makefile appropriately).

You need to link with a curses library that understands Unicode characters,
usually named libncursesw (the development headers for libncursesw are
usually in /usr/include/ncursesw).


Building:

* cd to the source directory.

* Most users can simply type 'make' without any extra flags, and get a
  working build as a result.  If just typing 'make' works for you, then you
  shouldn't need to read any further.  BSD and Solaris users may have to use
  'gmake' instead of 'make'.

* If you want a graphical (tiled) build, then you should add 'TILES=y' to
  the 'make' command-line, like so:

    make TILES=y

  Note that the graphical build requires that you have development libraries
  installed for SDL, SDL_image, libpng, zlib, and freetype.  If your system
  doesn't have these installed, you can usually get them via your package
  manager (apt-get, emerge, yum, etc).

  If you would rather, you can go to the source/contrib directory and type
  'make', and the required libraries should be built for you.

* If you want to install Crawl system-wide rather than play from the build
  directory, you need to specify a directory to hold the save and data files.
  Specifying a prefix of /usr or /usr/local will default SAVEDIR to
  "~/.crawl" and DATADIR to share/crawl (relative to the prefix).
  SAVEDIR must be writeable and owned by the user running crawl, so except
  for special cases it should be inside "~" (home directory).

* If you're installing Crawl for multiple users, run 'make install' as root.
  Crawl will be copied into the directory specified by 'prefix' (see above).
  The data directory will be created if necessary, and the level layout,
  tile and help files will be copied there.

* If you do not want players to be able to script Crawl with Lua, add
  'NO_LUA_BINDINGS=y' to the 'make' command-line. This removes functionality
  like autofight, and Lua scripts have been enabled on public servers for
  many years without any security issues, so there is no real reason to do
  so.


Building on Mac OS X
--------------------

Before building on Mac OS X, you need a working copy of Xcode and the
associated command line tools. For recent versions of OS X, Xcode can be
installed through the AppStore as a free download; the associated command
line tools can then be installed by opening Xcode, opening the Preferences
dialog, and clicking Install on the Command Line Tools line in the Download
tab.

Mac builds then use the Unix build process described above, but require you
to add 'APPLE_GCC=y' to the 'make' command-line. In addition, to build the
graphical version of Crawl, you must add 'NO_PKGCONFIG=y' and
'CONTRIB_SDL=y'.

So, to build build Crawl on a Mac you could use the following example
command lines.

For the console version:
  make APPLE_GCC=y
For the graphical version:
  make APPLE_GCC=y NO_PKGCONFIG=y CONTRIB_SDL=y TILES=y


Building on Windows (MinGW)
---------------------------

NOTE: You cannot build Windows binaries on Windows 9x/ME using MinGW. On
9x/ME, you can use the Cygwin build instructions, or build a binary on a
Windows NT/2k/XP system (although it would require a good bit of porting to
run on 9x).

* To build Crawl on Windows, first download and install msysgit. msysgit is
  a full MinGW setup that even includes Git (which happens to be the source
  code management system used by the Crawl team). To get msysgit, download
  'msysGit-netinstall' from here:

    http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=net+installer

  NOTE: msysgit should be installed to a path that does not contain spaces,
        such as the default location 'c:\msysgit'.

* Start msys by running 'c:\msysgit\msys.bat'. Now you're in a MinGW build
  environment.

* cd to the the Crawl source directory. For instance, if you have the crawl
  sources in c:\crawl\source, you would type 'cd /c/crawl/source'.

* Build Crawl by running 'make'. If you want a graphical build, you will
  need to add 'TILES=y' on the 'make' command line.

* When the process finishes, you should be able to run crawl right from the
  source directory by typing './crawl'

* If you get a message about missing SDL.h even though you do have contribs
  installed, your version of msys may suffer from a bug that has been fixed
  since.  Please either update msys, or delete /mingw/bin/sdl-config so it
  won't interfere with the copy shipped with Crawl.

* For you stubborn types who insist on using separate msys and git installs,
  make sure git.exe is in your PATH when trying to build from git! Otherwise,
  util/gen_ver.pl will most likely fail to generate build.h.

Building on Windows (cygwin)
----------------------------

* Get Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com/. When installing, ensure that the
  following packages are selected: gcc, g++, make, flex, bison,
  libncurses-devel.  If you'd like to build from git, install the git-core
  package.  You may also want to install diff, patch, and other such tools.

* Once Cygwin is installed, open a Cygwin bash shell (use the Start menu or
  desktop icon, do not double-click bash.exe in Explorer).

* cd to the the Crawl source directory. For instance, if you have the crawl
  sources in c:\crawl\source, you would type 'cd /cygdrive/c/crawl/source'.

* Follow the Linux build instructions to build Crawl.

Building on Windows (MSVC)
--------------------------

* If you do not have Visual Studio 2012 you can get the free Express edition
  (for Desktop) from http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads
  (look for Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop).

* You'll need a perl environment, there are links to several Windows binaries
  you can choose from at http://www.perl.org/get.html

* In the Crawl source, run gen-all.cmd which is in source/util/. This step
  must be executed any time you update to a new version of the source (or
  if you have modified tile data or unrandarts).

* The first time you compile, you need to build the Contribs solution. This
  compiles various libraries which crawl itself needs to build. This only
  needs to be performed the first time you build, or if the contribs are
  ever updated (extremely rare). To do this open and compile Contribs.sln
  in source/contrib.

* Open crawl-ref.sln in Visual Studio, this is in source/MSVC/.

* You can now select Debug or Release from the drop-down build configurations
  menu on the main toolbar (it should be next to "Local Windows Debugger");
  crawl.exe can them be compiled by selecting "Build Solution" in the BUILD
  menu. You can quickly run it by selecting "Start without Debugging" in the
  debug menu (or debug with "Start Debugging" but the game will run extremely
  slowly). Note: the Release build can still be debugged using the Visual
  Studio debugger.

* Better support for Python (for the webserver project) and Lua (for the dat
  project) can be installed with these extensions:

  Python Tools for Visual Studio
  http://pytools.codeplex.com/releases

  Ports of VsLua to Visual Studio 2012
  http://www.dbfinteractive.com/forum/index.php?topic=5873.0
  http://pouet.net/topic.php?which=9087

  Try at your own risk, but the first one has been tested and found to be
  effective.

Building Tiles versions
-----------------------

* On most platforms, you can simply type:
    make TILES=y

* If you compiled the ASCII binary before, you'll need to run 'make clean'
  before running 'make'.

* All platforms require the same prerequisites listed in the other sections
  above for building each of these platforms.

* All platforms additionally require the development versions of the
  following software packages installed.

    * SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php)
    * SDL_image (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
    * libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
    * Freetype 2 (http://www.freetype.org/download.html)

  On Linux, these can be installed via a package manager (apt-get, emerge,
  yum, etc).

  On Mac OS X, these will be compiled automatically when you build the Xcode
  project.

  On Windows (MinGW or Cygwin), these will be compiled as needed when you
  run 'make TILES=y'.

* If you want both ASCII and Tiles binaries you need to compile them
  separately, rename one of them, and copy them into the same Crawl
  directory.


*****************************************************************************
Data files
----------

Crawl looks for several data files when starting up. They include:

* Special level and vault layout (dat/*.des) files.
* Core Lua code (dat/dlua/*.lua).
* Descriptions for monsters and game features (dat/descript/*.txt).
* Definitions for monster dialogue and randart names (dat/database/*.txt).

All these files are in the source tree under source/dat.

Crawl will also look for documentation files when players invoke the help
system.  These files are available under the docs directory.

Your built Crawl binary must be able to find these files, or it will not
start.

If Crawl is built without an explicit DATA_DIR_PATH (this is the most common
setup), it will search for its data files under the current directory, and
if it can't find them there, one level above the current directory.  In
short, it uses these search paths: ., ./dat, ./docs, .., ../dat, ../docs.


*****************************************************************************

The level compiler
------------------

Crawl uses a level compiler to read the level design (.des) files in the
source/dat directory.

If you're using one of standard makefile, the steps described in this
section are performed automatically:

The level compiler source is in the source/util directory (levcomp.lpp and
levcomp.ypp).  The steps involved in building the level compiler are:

* Run flex on levcomp.lpp to produce the levcomp.lex.cc lexer.
* Run bison on levcomp.ypp to produce the levcomp.tab.cc parser and
  levcomp.tab.h
* Compile the resulting C++ source files and levcomp.cc and link the object
  files into the Crawl executable.

For convenience on systems that don't have flex/bison, pre-generated
intermediate files are provided under source/prebuilt.  The makefiles
provided with the Crawl source distribution will use these pre-generated
files automatically if flex/bison is not available.


*****************************************************************************
Optional Libraries (Lua and PCRE)
---------------------------------

Lua
---

Security on multiuser systems (Unix):

As of 0.8, setuid and setgid installs are no longer supported, thus any
previous concerns are no longer applicable.  Lua user scripts are sandboxed
and should be generally safe even on public servers (besides increasing the
attack surface).

As of 0.3, the Lua source is included with Crawl.  It will be used if you
don't have Lua headers installed.  Note that we don't provide security
support for Lua, and thus if you run a public server or a kiosk, it is
strongly recommended to use system Lua which does receive security updates
from whatever distribution you use.


PCRE
----
As of 0.6.0, PCRE 7.9 source is included with Crawl.  It is enabled by
default.  The sources in contrib/pcre are identical to the 7.9 distro except
for the use of a custom-made Makefile instead of the automake system that
was in place previously.

On Unixes, you're better served by the existing POSIX regular expression
support.  If you want PCRE, your package management system is again your
best bet.  Remember to install development headers, not just the plain
library.


Unicode
-------
As of 0.8, Unicode support is included in all ports.  Still, you might need
to ensure your terminal can display non-basic glyphs.

On Unix, you want an UTF-8 locale.  All modern distributions install one by
default, but you might have somehow dropped required settings.  To check
this, run "locale charmap", which should say "UTF-8".  If it's not, please
ensure either LANG, LC_ALL or LC_CTYPE is set.  A typical line would be
"export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8".

On Windows, the console behaves differently for TrueType and legacy (bitmap)
fonts.  The latter (mostly) work only on certain language editions of
Windows, such as English, and even there, they work adequately only for
Crawl's default settings.  For anything more, please select one of TrueType
fonts.  If, like one of our players, you are deeply attached to the looks of
bitmap fonts, you can download a corrected version of the Terminal font from
http://www.yohng.com/software/terminalvector.html
