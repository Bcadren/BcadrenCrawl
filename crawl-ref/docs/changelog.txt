Branches, environment
---------------------
* A new branch: the Enchanted Forest, alternating with Crypt; five levels
  long, and contains the entrance to Tomb where it exists.
* Branches now have exactly one exit stair (except the Dungeon, which can,
  but is not guaranteed, to have more).
* Many new layouts have been added to most branches, including unique layouts
  for branches that didn't have them; and numerous tweaks and improvements
  to existing layouts.
* Vaults can now be placed at the centre of some layouts prepared to accept
  them there.
* All portal vaults entrances that time out are now announced.

Character
---------
* New races:
    - Lava Orcs heat up and cool down in response to their surroundings, with
      their abilities changing as a result;
    - Djinni draw both health and magic from a shared Essence pool, and have
      complete immunity to all forms of fire;
    - Gargoyles are immune to involuntary petrification, but can petrify
      themselves to significantly reduce damage before becoming completely
      immobile.
* Sludge elves are no more.
* The Skald background gets a reworked spellbook with four new spells:
    - Infusion grants additional melee damage costing MP with each strike;
    - Song of Slaying grants an incremental slaying bonus with every monster
      killed (of sufficient threat level);
    - Spectral Weapon creates an allied spectral clone of your weapon
      which strikes enemies in melee when you do.
    - Song of Shielding has a similar effect to Spirit Shield, trading HP
      loss for MP loss.
* Priests are no more.
* The nausea status from eating contaminated chunks has been removed;
  contaminated chunks now give less nutrition for characters that can't
  handle them.
* Stabbing skill is no more; stabs now depend upon the average of the
  character's stealth and weapon skill.
* Chaos knights start with a +0 chaos weapon instead of a +2 normal weapon.
* New tier 2 demonspawn mutation - "magic shield", giving spirit shield
  at level one, improved magic regeneration at level two, and regenerating
  mana in place of health as a function of current magic level at level
  three.
* Deaths to acid, self-targetting, draining, and sticky flame now credit
  the appropriate monster/spell.

Monsters
--------
* New/reworked Crypt monsters:
    - Wraiths, shadow wraiths, and eidolons drain speed instead of XP.
    - Eidolons deal more melee damage and can cast bolt of draining.
    - Phantasmal warriors can temporarily reduce their target's magic
      resistance and can blink closer to their foes.
    - Flayed ghosts gain a smite-targetted flaying attack, dealing
      temporary damage that scales with XP and goes away when the flayed
      ghost is killed and/or enough time passes.
    - Ancient champions, formerly a vault-specific monster, are now
      full randomly-generated monsters, coming with a band of skeletal
      warriors 50% of the time.
    - Vampire mages cast vampiric draining more often, and have slightly
      higher HD and HP; they also come with a band of vampires.
    - Rotting hulks are now plague shamblers, capable of inflicting a
      "retching" status effect that prevents food consumption; they
      generate a cloud of miasma on death.
    - Spectral things move at their full base monster speed.
    - Deep dwarf death knights gain slightly better attack power and
      starting equipment, and now come with a band of undead.
    - Flying skulls get a slight HP boost and a larger attack power boost.
    - Ghouls inflict rot half as often.
    - New monster: revenants, possessing a ghostly fireball attack and
      capable of creating clouds of ghostly flame, which do not harm
      undead and occasionally summon spectral things.
    - New monster: lost souls, who sacrifice themselves to heal nearby
      undead creatures or assume the shape of a nearby killed living
      creature; they can be summoned by deep elf death mages.
    - Necromancers don't come with necrophages, but do some with simulacra.
    - New monster: jiangshi, who move in short burts (like sixfirhies) and
      possess a vampiric melee attack.
* New Forest monsters:
    - Dryads, who kite the player with Awaken Forest (but move at delay 12,
      so are not unreasonably difficult to catch).
    - Forest drakes, who move through trees and can breathe powerful blasts
      of wind.
    - Fauns and satyrs, who hex the player before attacking with longbows.
    - Tengu conjurers, warriors, and reavers, who use conjurations, powerful
      weapons, or both respectively against the player.
    - Spriggan assassins and enchanters, who attempt to disable the player
      with blowguns and hexes respectively before moving in for the kill.
* New uniques:
    - Pan, lord of the satyrs.
    - Sojobo, king of the tengu.
* Adjustments to some tier 4 demons:
    - Orange demons' sting has a 50% chance of inflicting a Weakness status,
      which reduces the player's attack damage.
    - Blue devils have a swooping attack, where they can immediately move
      adjacent to the player and attack from up to four tiles away.
    - Red devils can now hop backwards from adjacent foes to make use of their
      now-guaranteed polearms' reaching attacks.
* Adjustments to the elementals:
    - Water elementals have an asphyxiation attack which lasts as long as
      their target is next to them, and have slightly increased AC and HP.
    - Fire elementals (and fire vortices) deal pure fire damage.
* Draconian shifters have an updated spell set:
    - Banishment is dropped.
    - A new monster spell: Dimension Anchor, which temporarily prevents
      teleportation, blinking, and Phase Shift.
    - A new monster spell: Blink Allies Encircling, which blinks nearby
      allies around the target.
    - Controlled Blink is replaced with Blink Away as an emergency spell.
* Shadows can now turn invisible, allowing them to move faster and
  land a guaranteed stab attack on enemies.
* The lantern of shadows' rate of shadow spawning scales with evocations,
  and the resulting shadows now wander instead of following the player.
* Zombies no longer appear excessively out of depth in the early dungeon.
* Orb run monster spawns no longer include weak monsters, and now include
  Orb Guardians.
* Monster actions are now taken in order of speed, rather than any given
  monster taking all of its actions at once.
* A large number of vault-specific monsters have been removed.
* Imps and other weak monsters no longer appear in Pan.
* Nergalle appears earlier in the dungeon.

Spells
------
* Summon Small Mammals now only ever summons one mammal, and is renamed to
  Summon Small Mammal as a consequence.
* 100% of teleports on the orb run are delays (up from 50%).
* Haunt adjustments:
    - Summons now fixate on their target.
    - Flayed ghosts are no longer summoned.
    - Friendlies are no longer targettable.
* Summons caps are introduced. This acts on a per-spell basis, each spell
  has a fixed numerical limit for the number of summons active at any time.
  Going over this limit means your oldest summons will expire in a very
  short number of turns. Applies only to non-necromantic non-permanent
  summons.
* Temporary summons will no longer follow the player down stairs.
* Temporary summons expire when the player moves to a different level.

Items
-----
* The elemental evocation items have been reworked:
    - All no longer depend on elemental magic skill or nearby terrain, can
      summon multiple elementals, and have an XP-based recharge timer.
    - The lamp of fire fires up to three trails of flame in a given direction.
    - The fan of air elementals is now the fan of gales, and blows back
      nearby enemies.
    - The stone of earth elementals is now the stone of tremors; when used
      on a wall, it creates a shockwave along the wall, damaging adjacent
      walls and creatures (sometimes shafting the latter).
    - A new elemental evoker item - the phial of floods; it generates a wave
      of water which temporarily leaves a pool of water behind, and summons
      water elementals.
* The dependence of armour penalties on strength has been adjusted; there
  are no longer magic strength numbers for lowest possible penalties.
* Potions of gain <ability> have been replaced by potions of beneficial
  mutation, which grant the player a single beneficial mutation.
* Lear's chain mail is now Lear's hauberk - a +27 chain mail that covers
  all armour slots other than shields and cloaks.
* The staves of energy eliminates 100% of spell hunger again, and includes
  the now-gone staff of channeling as well.
* The staff of power scales with your maximum magic power.
* Splint mail has been removed; chain mail is now 8 AC to compensate.
* Needles of sickness have been removed.
* Box of Beasts has been reworked:
    - Has a fixed, random number of charges between 5 and 15 inclusive
    - 1/3 chance to fail on usage with no bad effects
    - When successful, generates a chimera; a new monster with three heads.
      Each head can be a different beast, picked from a list which provides
      better/stronger beasts at higher Evocations skill. The heads determine
      the attacks and abilities available to the monster.
* New "Sack of Spiders" item:
    - Fixed charges between 5 and 15 inclusive
    - On evoking, creates webs around you and releases spiders
    - Number of webs and type/number of spiders scales with Evo

Branches, environment
---------------------

  with "interesting brands" instead of just one.
* The Abyss is revamped yet again. It now contains five (still infinite)
  levels of increasing difficulty. Each level is composed of regions with
  different layouts, most of which are more static than before. The rune
  appears only at the third level and below, more frequently at deeper levels.
* The Abyssal rune always appears in a vault, never lying around on the floor.
* Having the Abyssal rune greatly increases the generation of Abyss exits.
* Many Ziggurat floors have more fine-tuned monster-sets, and a few monster
  sets have been replaced entirely.

  Blood" both by st.

---------

* Gladiator no longer starts with a buckler, gets more Dodging to compensate.

  boost) at XL 14.
* Removed the hidden special cost of Spellcasting, Stealth, Evocations and

      more masses become visible.
    - Apocalypse crab: breathes clouds of chaos.
    - Thrashing horror: moves like a bat, tramples, and frenzies.
    - Spatial maelstrom: incorporeal vortex that turns walls into spatial

      troll pack to pursue their opponent.

      for a time or until they are killed.

      projectile that can knock monsters backwards.

      bolts that can blind creatures.

-----
* Axes have a cleaving attack: they hit up to seven targets with a single

  but not if a wall is in the way). These secondary attacks do only 75%
  damage and do not hit allies. Base damage for the larger axes is reduced

  a one point damage increase, and morningstars get a +3/-1 damage/accuracy
  boost to replace spiked flails.

  the player will turn them into a random form (including several new forms -

  Trog).
* Improved fixedarts: Spear of the Botono, Robe of Night, Cloak of the Thief,
  Robe of Folly, plutonium sword.

  default.
* List options can be prepended to with ^=.

  "forbidden".

  out-of-range monster before falling back to the player's position,
