Dungeon

It is still a mystery how this bizarre place was created. Some claim that it is
the playground of bored gods, whereas others maintain that it was shaped by all
kinds of species who fled the overworld and shunned the light. No matter what
its origin, this deep cavern is filled with riches unheard of as well as with
ample dangers to any intruder. Few have escaped alive, and even fewer have kept
some sliver of sanity sufficient to tell the tale.

The dungeon is 15 levels deep, but, honestly, this is only the beginning.
%%%%
Temple

The Ecumenical Temple is a place of peace and refuge from the insanity of the
dungeon. It usually contains altars to most of the known gods. It is located
between the levels 4 and 7 of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Orcish Mines

These bustling goldmines are filled with orcs, their humanoid labourers, and
piles of freshly mined gold. Enterprising merchants have set up trading posts
to help relieve the orcs of the latter. Prospective customers should be warned:
the haphazard manner in which orcs dig their mineshafts has resulted in a
complex and treacherous tangle of chambers, in which it is easy to be trapped.

They are filled with the noise of industry, and thus all sounds travel less
far.

The Orcish Mines are four levels deep and contain the entrance to the Elven
Halls.
%%%%
Elven Halls

This is the realm of the deep elves, a race that turned their backs on the sun
long ago. Their halls are filled with riches, but a deadly welcome awaits any
would-be robbers. In their long seclusion, the deep elves have perfected dark
sorceries of a power the orcs can only dream of!

The Elven Halls are three levels deep.
%%%%
Lair

Most adventurers find the Lair of Beasts to be an exciting change of climate.
And indeed, there is something to be said about getting gored, mauled and eaten
rather than sliced, burnt or stabbed.

It is filled with the noise of nature, and thus all sounds travel less far.

The Lair is eight levels deep and contains the stairs to three more branches.
%%%%
Swamp

A swampy wasteland, the Swamp is filled with ooze, muck, flies and large
slavering carnivorous monsters.

The Swamp is five levels deep and contains the decaying rune. A dungeon
features only one of the Swamp and Shoals branches. If the Swamp is present,
the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.
%%%%
Shoals

The exotic underground beaches of the Shoals make up a few small islands in a
seemingly endless sea. The merfolk have made it their home, alongside many
dreaded sea creatures.

It is filled with the noise of the sea breaking on sand, and thus all sounds
travel less far.

The Shoals are five levels deep and contain the barnacled rune. A dungeon
features only one of the Shoals and Swamp branches. If the Shoals are present,
the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.
%%%%
Snake Pit

The corridors of the Snake Pit are home to all varieties of serpent, and are
inhabited by a society of powerful nagas and salamanders.

The Snake Pit is five levels deep and contains the serpentine rune. A dungeon
features only one of the Snake Pit and Spider Nest branches. If the Snake Pit
is present, the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.
%%%%
Spider Nest

The crumbling, web-choked caverns of the Spider Nest are packed with poisonous
arthropods and assorted creepy-crawlies.

The Spider Nest is five levels deep and contains the gossamer rune. A dungeon
features only one of the Spider Nest and Snake Pit branches. If the Spider Nest
is present, the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.
%%%%
Slime Pits

The Slime Pits are the amorphous realm of acids, jellies and slimes. Even the
walls drip with painful acid, growing ever more caustic as one travels deeper.
Any trace of intelligent beings has long been dissolved. Still, there are
rumours of great treasures deep down, hidden safely away in secret chambers
without door or window.

The only noise here is the occasional drip of acid, and thus all sounds travel
further.

The Slime Pits are six levels deep and contain the slimy rune. The entry is
between Lair:6 and Lair:8.
%%%%
Vaults

Possibly constructed by some powerful madman, the Vaults are said to be home to
great treasures. The blood spattered liberally around the entrance suggests
that there is a certain amount of violence, too.

The Vaults are five levels deep and contain the silver rune, as well as the
entrances to two more branches. They can only be entered while carrying at
least one rune of Zot. The entrance can be found on either level 13 or 14 of
the main dungeon.
%%%%
Crypt

The Crypt is a huge repository for the ancient dead. The air is chill and
fetid, the walls cold and damp. Bones are strewn liberally everywhere, and
every noise echoes worryingly, violating the overbearing silence of the grave.

It is suffused with the silence of the grave, and thus all sounds travel
further.

The Crypt is three levels deep, and contains the entrance to the Tomb. Its entry
is either on Vaults:2 or Vaults:3.
%%%%
Tomb

The Tomb of the Ancients is a place of damnation, of horrors animated by the
vilest necromancy. The list of those who have returned from this place of pure
death is exceedingly short.

It is suffused with the silence of the grave, and thus all sounds travel much
further.

The Tomb is three levels deep and contains the golden rune. Its entry is on
Crypt:3.
%%%%
Hell

The hallway to the four hells is guarded by Geryon. The Vestibule of Hell
contains portals to Dis, Gehenna, Cocytus and Tartarus.

Portals to the Vestibule of Hell are found abundantly in the Depths.
%%%%
Dis

Who will stand the test of iron?

Dis is seven levels deep and contains the iron rune. It can be accessed via the
Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Gehenna

Gehenna is a realm of flames, lava and hellfire.

Gehenna is seven levels deep and contains the obsidian rune. It can be accessed
via the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Cocytus

Cocytus is a grim and frost-bitten wasteland.

Cocytus is seven levels deep and contains the icy rune. It can be accessed via
the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Tartarus

Tartarus is a decaying netherworld. Over time, the undead, demons and devils of
this place drain the life from any who dare to enter.

Tartarus is seven levels deep and contains the bone rune. It can be accessed
via the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Zot

The Realm of Zot is a region of the dungeon that is so terrifying, so full of
madness, frenzy and lunacy, that it has been locked securely against random
trespassers. Only the most demented adventurers would dare gather the required
keys, break the seal and penetrate deeper — all in the vain hope for a fabled
artefact no one has ever laid eyes on before.

The Realm of Zot is five levels deep and can only be entered when carrying at
least three runes.
%%%%
Abyss

The Abyss is a truly bizarre place, ever-changing and twisted. It is filled
with all sorts of monsters, mostly of demonic nature, whose common aim is to
feast on intruders. It is also the garbage dump for many sorcerers, who delight
in sending would-be champions like you to these proving grounds of madness.
Reportedly, there is some structure to the chaos, as Lugonu seems to concoct
schemes around this place and its denizens.

The Abyss consists of five infinite levels. The abyssal rune can be found from
the third level onwards, and is more common at greater depths. The Abyss can be
purposefully reached through portals in the Depths. Portals back to the dungeon
are scattered throughout the Abyss, and are found more commonly at greater
depths or while carrying the abyssal rune.
%%%%
Pandemonium

Pandemonium is an infinite realm of pain and suffering. While there are many
treasures to be found within, they are guarded by cruel demons and even
crueller demon lords.

Pandemonium is endless. Portals leading there are found in the Depths. Note
that getting back might be more difficult.

No fewer than five runes can be found in Pandemonium:
 • a fiery rune in the well-heated realm of Cerebov
 • a glowing rune in the contaminated domain of Mnoleg
 • a magical rune guarded by the arcane powers of Lom Lobon and his minions
 • a dark rune in the shadowy abode of Gloorx Vloq
 • a demonic rune existing in multiple places, owned by less famous lords
%%%%
Ziggurat

A ziggurat is a strange tower constructed of twenty seven levels of
incrementally larger combat arenas, each containing greater wealth and even
greater danger than the last. Beware, for a ziggurat is not a place for the
faint of heart: even the bravest and most skilled adventurers have met their
ends in one. While a portal to safety will be present on every level, once
left, a ziggurat cannot be re-entered.

One ziggurat is guaranteed in the Depths, and further ones can be found
in Pandemonium. These towers and their contents will react violently to
those that can conquer them, and scale up according to how many ziggurats
an adventurer has completed.

It can only be entered when carrying at least two runes of Zot.
%%%%
Labyrinth

The labyrinth is a complex, ever-shifting maze designed by subtle and malicious
minds for reasons long lost to history. Old stories say that the labyrinth was
constructed as a prison for a fearsome minotaur. More recent stories say this
beast dwells there still, guarding the labyrinth's sole exit — as well as a
rich hoard of treasure taken from the bodies of foolish adventurers.
%%%%
Bazaar

While some merchants set up shop in the dungeon, others travel in caravans from
place to place. The bazaars of these intinerant traders feature a number of
different shops and often have better stock than the sedentary ones, sometimes
even at a bargain.
%%%%
Trove

Once upon a time, an enterprising thief and wizard created a system of portals
leading into the secret treasure troves and chambers of the rich. Too scared to
loot them himself, he instead charged an extortionate fee for entry to anyone
who wanted to rifle through them.

The items inside this trove are likely to be useful, but beware: the wizard is
long dead, and even while alive he never offered a money-back guarantee.
%%%%
Sewer

Every inhabited place needs to dispose of its waste products. The Dungeon too
has its stinking sewers and drains, full of filthy water and ignored by most
but used as hideaways by the disgusting and the desperate. Old tales speak of
dangerous creatures stalking through the foul-smelling green water, preying on
each other without mercy. The tales also allude to valuable items accidentally
washed into the drainage tunnels, forgotten and left to grow mouldy in the damp
caverns.
%%%%
Ossuary

The ossuary is a small tomb containing the remains and grave goods of some
distant relatives of the pharaohs, along with the corpses of their retainers
and household animals. It is undoubtedly riddled with many traps, and its
undead denizens are unlikely to take kindly to looting.
%%%%
Bailey

The bailey is the still-occupied and well-guarded fortress of an orcish lord.
The treasures within are protected by both physical barriers and large numbers
of well-armed humanoid warriors.
%%%%
Ice Cave

The ice cave is a desolate cavern shaped from solid ice and filled with the
echoes of bestial howls. The intricate carvings and statues which once lined
its walls have been warped and obscured by centuries of slow melting and
refreezing.
%%%%
Volcano

Built from enormous blocks of obsidian, this sweltering chamber may once have
served as a temple to some strange deity, or perhaps the dwelling of a mighty
fire giant. The air shimmers with oppressive heat, and the dull roar of the
volcano's heart never ceases.
%%%%
Wizlab

In ages past, the most powerful mages would frequently find or construct small
realms sealed off from the rest of the world, where they could isolate
themselves in the pursuit of ever-greater magical knowledge and power. The
mages are long gone, but many of their arcane laboratories still exist, filled
with the results of their experiments. Those willing to explore these
laboratories may find powerful magical treasures, but be warned: any wizard
capable of constructing such a realm deserved their reputation.
%%%%
Depths

The Depths are the deepest part of the dungeon proper, subject to the
corrupting influence of the Realm of Zot without being considered a part of it.

The Depths are five levels deep and can be entered from the lowest floor of the
Dungeon.
%%%%
