# Principal goal: a very early portal vault, like Sewer or Ossuary, which
# starts with the player liberating or otherwise acquiring an ally, and then
# fighting as a team for the prize.
#
#   - depth range D:3-8 (in two sets: early=D:3-5 and late=D:6-8)
#   - small levels (I think that some Sewer maps are already too big)
#   - both ally or player alone are too weak to win the fight
#
# Because of the last goal, the portal vault makes a lot more sense in the
# early game. Also place only one exit, right next to the entrance. (To make
# it harder to skip ally & fighting, and just steal the loot.) The maps will
# be made from subvaults. Choke points can exist, but don't have to.
#
# How to gain ally:
#   1. Ally is fighting some monsters when the player arrives. If the player
#      dawdles or fights badly, the ally dies.
#   2. The ally is imprisoned and the player must defeat the guards. (Can use
#      a small room with a runed door and some glass window. Ally may sleep.)
#   3. Rarely, the ally is weak but has a scroll of summoning or a wand of
#      enslavement (on the floor, in his prison).
#
# What kinds of allies:
#   1. A humanoid: big kobold; gnoll; type 4 demon. Centaur?
#   2. An early unique: Sigmund; Crazy Yiuf etc.
#   3. An animal (presumably stored for food or labour): yak; two sheep.
#   4. An undead (shut away by locals): strong zombie/skeleton; necrophage.
#
# The opposition:
# Should be meat bag melee monsters, rangers may be okay. No casters or
# summoners: this is very early game! The opposition should come in two or
# three waves, so that the player can get a feeling for the combined power
# of character + ally.
#   1. Kobolds (with big kobold at end).
#   2. Orcs (with orc warrior at end).
#   3. Gnolls (having good weapons at the end).
#   4. Hobgoblin (having axes; ogre at end).
#   5. type 5 demons (type 4 demon at end).
#
# Loot:
#   - the ally will not leave the vault, so is not part of the prize
#   - early loot: some consumable of the ally (e.g. in the prison);
#     should be pre-identified if the ally is intelligent (he can tell you)
#   - I am not sure if I can do this in lua, but it would be cool if the
#     prize could be a randart weapon (base type hand axe, club, spear) like
#     "bane of kobolds", "Sigmund's Friendship", "[player]'s Pride"
#
# The combination ally vs opposition can be random, and in almost all cases a
# player who wants to can make a story out of it. (E.g. gnolls have locked away
# a big kobold, perhaps in a tribe war, or for theft. Or minor demons have
# captured a humanoid, probably for a dark ritual.)
#
# There can also be pre-assigned combinations. Examples:
#   - opposition consists of humanoids (orcs or gnolls or kobolds), the
#     ally is one of them, imprisoned and carrying a wand of enslavement or
#     a scroll of summoning
#   - ally is Pikel, opposition are humans
#   - ally is Duwan (or Duvessa); the other twin is at the end of the map
#
# For later:
#   - Could sometimes employ religion: e.g. the humanoids who have captured a
#     demon follow Elyvilon, or the kobolds who imprisoned some unique follow
#     an evil god. Should player religion play a role? (We could rationalise
#     this away by saying that you'd only be called for help if you would.)
#   - If the player already has a god, the ally could sometimes have an altar
#     to that god next to him in his prison)... probably made by him during
#     custody. This would explain why and how he called for help.
#   - It is possible to have speech lines depending on branch, I hope this
#     includes special portal vaults. If so, we could have special lines for
#     your buddy Sigmund fighting on your side...
#
# Note: the player can kill his ally (backstabbing). This is intentional and
# should not be punished or commented on within the game. (The log will tell.)
